# Component-demo

### Clone the Component-Demo Repository

```bash
# Clone this repo to <your componentname>
$ git clone https://github.com/nytpi/component-demo.git <your componentname>
$ cd <your componentname>
# Make this repo your own
$ rm -rf .git
$ git init
$ git remote add origin <your repo>
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
git push origin master
# Install NPM dependencies
npm install
npm run preview
```

If all is well its time to start building...

So start by renaming samplecomponent and other related files based on your component's name. You will have to close the preview task and 'npm run preview' once you change filenames.
